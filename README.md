Hello, I'm Evelyn Vo, a software developer pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science with a focus in machine learning. 

I'm interested in AI, machine learning, database systems, and OS development. 

Languages I've worked with:
- Python
- Java
- C
- Scheme
- RISC-V Assembly
- HTML

Outside of tech, I'm also interested in:
- learning languages (I've studied Japanese, French, and Mandarin Chinese to varying degrees. I'm currently focusing on Mandarin.)
- studying history (Tom Standage's Edible History of Humanity and History of the World in 6 Glasses are among my favorite works)
